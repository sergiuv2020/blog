## Hi, I'm Sergiu... 

####I love quality,
I love solving problems,   
I love automating anything that stands in front of my precious time that helps me learn new things.

####I'm passionate about new technologies, 
passionate about DevOps,   
passionate about Serverless   
and passionate about IOT.

I'm passionate about finding out how things work.

####I also love to share what I know with the world, speaking when I get a chance.

So many passions, so little time, so I do what I can, when I can.

I started this blog too many years ago, I will try to rewamp it with a new concept. 
I want to keep it as my wiki... my little book of problems solved.

Enjoy reading, what is here is sometimes a minor thing, sometimes something truly awesome but I believe that is based a lot on who is reading it.
